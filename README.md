## Usage

### JSX

Next.js 13 Starter uses JSX for writing components. You can start creating your React components in the `components` directory.

### Route

Routes can be defined in the `pages` directory. Each file in the `pages` directory represents a route.

### Nested Route

To organize your routes in a nested structure, you can create directories inside the `pages` directory and place your route files inside those directories.

### Google Font

To use Google Fonts in your application, import the desired font in the `_app.js` file and add it to the `importFonts` array.

### Metadata API

Next.js 13 Starter automatically generates metadata for your pages based on the information provided in the `_app.js` file. You can customize the metadata for each page by editing the `head` attribute in the respective page file.

### Custom Loading

You can create custom loading indicators for your application by modifying the `Loading` component in the `components` directory.

### Dynamic Route

To define dynamic routes in your application, create a file in the `pages` directory with square brackets in the filename. For example, `pages/[id].js` represents a dynamic route with an `id` parameter.

### Caching & Revalidating

Optimize your application's performance by implementing caching and revalidating methods. Check the documentation for more information on how to use caching and revalidating in Next.js.

### Search

Implement search functionality in your Next.js application by using the Search API. Use the `get_web_search_results` function to retrieve real-time search results from the internet.
